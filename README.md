This project aims to make it simple and fast to interact with a postgresql database over http inspired by <a href="https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest">Postgrest</a>.


## Features

Currently, the application supports the following database interactions 
- inserts, 
- update where field=value,
- delete where field=value,
- get whole table, 
- get row by id, 
- get rows where field=value.

Other features
- For multi-row returns, the application writes rows back to the client as each row is read.
- Low memory requirement (around 8 MB of RAM used for entire docker container under high load. Allocate 16 MB to be generous).
- Database connection cache. Each request doesn't have to wait for a new connection to be made.
- Transfer binary-to-binary. Reading from Postgresql is done in binary and written back to the client without conversion etc.
- Set the database connection details using environment variables. Great for Cloud Native environments. 
- Dockefile with light, low attack-surface final image.
- Listen address can be set by an environment variable.

## Setup

### Providing database connection details
| Env | Description |
|---|---|
| listenAddr | Address to listen on for http request (for ex: :8080) |
| pghost | Postgresql hostname |
| pguser | Postgresql username |
| pgpassword | Postgresql password |
| pgdb | Postgresql database |
| pgport | Postgresql port |
| poolSize | Number of postgresql connections to keep open |

- Build from source or
- Run the Docker container `docker pull just1689/pg-gateway:latest`

You may need to set the search_path for the user.
```sql
ALTER USER postgres SET search_path to myschema
```

## Usage
For the examples below, we'll assume the application is hosted on localhost:8080

### Get all rows for that table
```shell script
curl http://localhost:8080/users
```
is the equivalent of  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
```



### Insert row into table
```shell script
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/entities \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"entity": "user",
	"id": "12",
	"name": "Justin"
}'
```
is the equivalent of  
```sql
INSERT INTO entities (entity, id, name) VALUES ("user", "12", "Justin")
```



### Update rows where field=value
```shell script
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/users/id/12
  http://localhost:8080/entities \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
	"entity": "user",
	"id": "12",
	"name": "Justin"
}'
```
is the equivalent of  
```sql
update entities set entity=$1, id=$2, v=$3 where id=$4
```



### Delete rows where field=value
```shell script
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/users/id/12
```
is the equivalent of  
```sql
DELETE FROM entities WHERE id=12
```



### Get rows a table where x=y
```shell script
curl http://localhost:8080/users/x/y
```
is the equivalent of  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE x=y
```



### Get row where id=z
```shell script
curl http://localhost:8080/users/z
```
is the equivalent of  
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=z
```



### Memory Usage
Memory usage after 1 million requests at a concurrency of 100 requests.

### Roadmap
| To do | Notes |
|---|---|
| Go client | For calling the library. |
| Handle options request | Allow calls from browsers &amp; frameworks using OPTIONS. |
| Better standard for returning errors | Important feature. |
| FastHTTP | Fewer allocs for each request. |
| Bulk inserts | Better insert performance. |
| Docker Service | Simple script to spin up db and service. |
| Pagination | Restricting result sets. |
| Complex queries | HUGE amount of work. |
| Deleting (complex) | Requires that complex queries are implemented. |
